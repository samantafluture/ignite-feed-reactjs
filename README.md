## when to create a separated component in React?

1. When something is being repeated too often
   - With same visuals, behaviors and functionalities
2. When you can remove something from a big component without breaking it
   - Than, this big component can have a clearer focus
   - Even though this new component is not reusable

## props

- When I want to use different visual characteristics and behaviors on a component, I should pass props 
- It's a form of communication
